Models Implemented

Linear Regression

Ridge Regression

Lasso Regression

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Decision Tree Regressor

Random Forest Regressor

AdaBoost Regressor

Support Vector Regressor (SVR)

Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

Each model is trained on the training set and evaluated on the validation set using the following metrics:

RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error): Measures the average magnitude of error.

RÂ² Score: Measures the proportion of variance explained by the model.
